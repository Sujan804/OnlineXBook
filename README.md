# OnlineXBook
This Django-based OnlineXBook was built using Python, Django, and a SQLITE3 database. The OnlineXBook is a basic project that can help book store owners provide an easy way for their consumers to perform online transactions. All of the store’s books are organized by book categories, and all of the store’s books for sale information is stored in the system.<br/>
